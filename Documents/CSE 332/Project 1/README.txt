Write-Up Questions Project 1


1)This project was a bit of a wakeup call. I have not programed since I took 143 a year ago. I pulled out some of my old assignments and they really helped to jog my memory. In particular, the Huffman project proved to be helpful when writing my node implementation.

2)I made my own test class to test my stack implementations. In it, I called each method multiple times and in different combinations to make sure my stacks did not fail. 

3)“The scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love ”

4)I did not use any other class.

5)For a .dat file with 1 million lines, the resizing would occur 20 times. For 1 billion, resizing would occur 30 times and for 	1 trillion resizing would occur 40 times. (Log base 2)

6)	
Q is a new queue
Public push(){
	Enqueue to Q
}
Public pop(d){
	If Q is empty
		Throw exception;
	T = Temp queue();	
	While list has more than one element{
		x = q.dequeue
		enqueue x to T 
	}
	Last = last element in list;
	Retrun last;
}

7)Using queues has a far worse run time than using an array or linked list. The pop and push method of both linked list and array list run in constant time while using a queue runs in O(n) for its pop method.

8)The only error I encountered was when I tried to make an array of generic type. This is not allowed as I discovered. You have to make an array of Objects and the cast to the generic T array. 

9)You did not have to know much. It was helpful to know how reverse used your program but it was simple to do. 

10)N/A

11)I liked how this assignment helped me remember how to actually code. It was a good refresher. I also liked it because we did something cool! I played the revered and unversed files for my friends and they all though I was super smart.
